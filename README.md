## ðŸŒŸ 100 Days of Code: Flutter Developer Journey ðŸŒŸ

# Day 1: #100DaysOfCode challenge continues! ðŸš€ Today, I learnt how to design user interfaces for Flutter apps from scratch! ðŸ’»âœ¨

Agenda included:
* Creating stateless widgets Difference between hot reload and hot refresh and running an app from cold 
* How to use Containers to lay out user interfaces
* How to add custom fonts like Google fonts 
* How to add Material icons 
* How to style Text widgets 
* Reading and use Flutter documentation

After all these, I created a simple Flutter app, "Mi Card". A personal business card.
